   <p>The <strong>cat</strong> <em>(Felis catus)</em>, commonly referred to as the domestic cat
     or house cat, is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae. Recent advances in 
     archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near
    East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely
    as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its
    ability to kill vermin. Because of its retractable claws it is adapted to killing small
    prey like mice and rats. It has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, 
    and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, 
    but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations
    like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language.
    It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by 
    small mammals. It also secretes and perceives pheromones.</p>
   <p>Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and 
    throughout the year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.
    Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy.
    Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation
    and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to 
    the extinction of bird, mammal and reptile species.</p>
   <h2>Etymology and naming</h2>
   <hr>
   <p>The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus,
     which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century.<sup><a href ="Cat#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> 
     The Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified African language.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-5">[5]
     </a></sup> The Nubian word kaddîska 'wildcat' and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.[6] The Nubian word may be a loan from Arabic قَطّ‎ qaṭṭ ~ قِطّ qiṭṭ.
