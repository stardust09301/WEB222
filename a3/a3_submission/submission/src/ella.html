      <!--Ella Fitzgerald's Short Biography-->
      <p>
        <strong>Ella Fitzgerald,</strong> <em>“The First Lady of Song,”</em> was
        a legendary American jazz singer of the 20th century, who lived through
        an era of racial discrimination. Born in 1917, Fitzgerald grew up in a
        diverse neighborhood in New York, where she enjoyed jazz and dance.
        However, her life took a difficult turn when her mother passed away,
        leading her to be sent to a harsh reform school. She escaped alone
        during the Great Depression, turning to singing and performing on Harlem
        to make a living. Ella lived to sing and loved to perform. By the end of
        her career, she had recorded 2,000 songs, earned fourteen Grammy awards.

      <!--Album Review-->
      <h2>Album Review</h2>
      <p>
        The album, "100 Songs For A Centennial Collection" is a special tribute
        to Ella Fitzgerald on her 100th birthday, featuring a chronological
        selection of her best songs at her peak in 2017. This album contains not
        only her great solo songs but also collaborations with various
        orchestras and jazz artists during the swing era, such as Chick Webb,
        Louis Armstrong, The Ink Spots, Count Basie, and Duke Ellington. I can
        picture her smiling while collaborating with other artists. I adore Ella
        for her smiles, exceptional talent in interpreting lyrics and melodies,
        and her scat singing influenced by jazz instrumentals.

        "People will say something, but you let it go by smiling, I've made more
        friends than if I was the other way." Her delightful and inviting smile
        made you want to listen. I love her personality, and I can imagine her
        smiling while singing <em>“A-Tisket, A-Tasket.”</em> In 1935, Chick
        Webb, the drummer, and bandleader, met 16-year-old Ella Fitzgerald.
        Though her sound was unformed, she was able to read music and quickly
        learn songs. She went on to co-write and record the mega-hit "A-Tisket,
        A-Tasket," based on the nursery rhyme. The melody and rhythm of
        "A-Tisket, A-Tasket" are simple and catchy, with clear vocals, and the
        repetition in the lyrics adds a playful rhythm to the song, even though
        the lyrics talk about a little girl who is sad after losing her basket.
        Ella's playful and expressive vocal tone, complemented by lively
        instruments, defines the song's timbre. She emphasizes lyrics like
        "market," "drop it," and "peck it" with accented notes, creating a
        joyful mood. While the song mainly focuses on Ella Fitzgerald's vocals,
        Chick Webb's band, including drums, brassy trumpets, trombones,
        saxophones, piano, and bass, contributes to the overall harmony.

        Louis Armstrong was already a jazz legend when he collaborated on their
        1956 album <strong>"Ella and Louis,"</strong> often referred to as "a
        musical marriage". The lyrics from the song, "Let's Call the Whole Thing
        Off" by George and Ira Gershwin is known for a couple playfully arguing
        over pronunciation and preferences. I found it interesting to hear the
        difference in pronunciations of 'either' or 'either' and 'potato' or
        'potato' in English when I listened to this song for the first time. The
        couple worries that these differences might lead to a breakup but
        decides to stay together, accepting differences in a relationship. The
        song begins with Ella's lovely singing and includes a piano.While both
        Ella and Louis use their unique voices to emphasize specific words and
        phrases, Louis's rich, gravelly tone complements Ella's clear, smooth
        voice. The song repeats melodic motifs, like "You say tomato, I say
        tomato," which makes the song catchy. The harmony is rich and colourful,
        with a focus on the vocalists and dense instruments like piano, drums,
        and horns. The playful call and response are observed between Ella and
        Louis. The timbre of the song is marked by the unique voices of Ella and
        Louis. Ella's voice is bright, clear, and smooth, while Louis's voice is
        warm and gravelly, creating a beautiful contrast.
