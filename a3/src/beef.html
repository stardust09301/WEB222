        The entertaining and impactful Netflix series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_(TV_series)"><strong>Beef</strong></a>
        is a 2023 American comedy-drama television series created by Korean American director Lee Sung Jin. <em>Beef</em> starts with 
        a minor incident in a mart parking lot where a man and a woman, unfamiliar with each other, provoke 
        each other's anger. It becomes a so-called road rage situation, where they fight while driving on the road.
        As the title suggests, it portrays humans as bundles of complaints and sadness.

   <!--The <sup> HTML element specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript-->
   <p>Eventually, the minor <em>road rage</em> incident escalates to an extraordinary climax, spreading on an 
    unimaginable scale. The drama's lead actress, Ali Wong<sup><a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Wong">[1]</a></sup>, 
    an American actress known for her stand-up comedy, displays remarkable acting skills in this series. As someone familiar with her 
    other movies and comedy, I was captivated by her compelling performance in this drama. The character portrayed by Ali Wong, 
    named <em>Amy,</em> is a composed career woman. She had considered taking a break after selling her company at a high price, 
    but the sale wasn't easy, and her seemingly good marriage also hit a rough patch. The road rage incident, which poked at her 
    discomfort, led Amy to project her life's dissatisfaction onto <em>Danny</em>, prompting a conflict between them. This part 
    highlights how frequently incidents like this occur for modern individuals or even for oneself, making life challenging.</p>

    <!--The <sup> HTML element specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript-->
   <p>The male lead of the series is Steven Yeun<sup><a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Yeun">[2]</a></sup>, 
    whom I admire from 'The Walking Dead.' In this drama, he delivers an outstanding performance. In fact, every actor in this 
    drama is truly remarkable in their acting skills, making this show highly recommended even for the sheer pleasure of watching 
    their performances. Steven Yeun's character, <em>Danny</em>, is the eldest son in a Korean immigrant family. As a Korean myself 
    and as an older daughter in my family, his character deeply resonates with me. He's always worried about his parents and his 
    naive younger sibling, bearing a sense of responsibility for everything, working hard in life, yet feeling a persistent sense 
    of frustration with the lack of improvement. He sometimes feels unfairly treated, yet he remains needlessly kind and occasionally 
    explodes with anger from trivial occurrencesâ€”a typical eldest son syndrome.</p>
   
    <p>The drama shows the lives of the two main characters as they engage in a series of small revenge actions stemming from the 
    road rage incident. It goes beyond simple tit-for-tat scenarios, portraying that humans aren't as simple as they might seem. 
    Both Danny and Amy carry wounds from their childhoods. They've strived to live life diligently for their families but have 
    suppressed their shadows, leading to unexpected outbursts of anger. The drama ultimately leads to a situation where both 
    characters confront and retain their shadows, accepting them within themselves, leading to a beautiful ending where they 
    experience true love.</p>
   
    <p>We all possess both light and dark sides. However, from an early age, the darker aspects of us are often not accepted. 
    We are forced to live a life where we're not allowed to get angry, hate, or be lazy. We suppress ourselves, leading to a 
    situation where a kind person suddenly becomes someone with anger management issues, the sincere one turns out to be an addict, 
    and the compassionate one might live with depression. We all possess the dark side as much as the bright side and that shadow 
    is an undeniable part of ourselves. Instead of denying it or disliking it, acknowledging and managing both the bright and dark 
    aspects of us is crucial. It's all part of who we are.</p>
